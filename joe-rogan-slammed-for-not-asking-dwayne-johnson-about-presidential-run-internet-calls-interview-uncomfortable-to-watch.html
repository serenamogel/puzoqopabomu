The majority of viewers found it entertaining to see him engage in some fascinating discussions with <a href=# rel=dofollow>Joe Rogan</a>.</p><p>However, MMA legend Chael Sonnen questioned the 56-year-old for failing to pose a crucial query to "The Rock" about his aspirations to become president throughout the three-hour show,&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Joe Rogan reveals how Kanye West's 'tornado of creativity' left him awestruck</a></p><h2 class=split>Joe Rogan misses out on asking Dwayne Johnson an important question</h2><p>Chael Sonnen reflected on the interview on an episode of 'Beyond The Fight', posting the clip on his YouTube channel. Chael Sonnen referred to Dwayne Johnson as the "coolest guy of his lifetime."</p><p>He referred to the period in 2016 when "The Rock" was thinking about running for president and received a lot of support from the American people.</p><p>Furthermore, the public continued to embrace the former 8-time WWE champion, even if he remained silent about his political beliefs. Sonnen had no doubts about his victory in that year's elections.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Joe Rogan and Dave Smith discuss 'hyper-inflation' and 'fractional reserve banking' during JRE podcast</a></p><p>“In 2016, when this started, he [The Rock] was flattered. I think he was stunned, ‘Oh my God! People like me this much. I never stated a view and you guys like me this much,’ and the answer is yes, he would have won in 2016. He would have won in a landslide,” Chael Sonnen said.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Dana White shares his take on Clay Guida with Joe Rogan: 'How about the chin on him still'</a></p><p>However, when rumors began to circulate that Dwayne Johnson was leaning left, things kind of took a different turn. As a result, the Hollywood celebrity withdrew from the presidential contest.</p><p>Sonnen recalled, “But when it started coming out that he was leaning left, the left will eat their own and they came after him instantly. They let him know right away, ‘Do not feign this… Here’s what will happen if you back down.’</p><p>“And he backed down. Quickly,” Sonnen added. He then questioned Joe Rogan's decision to skip over questioning Johnson about the incident in his three-hour podcast.</p><p>During his appearance on 'The Joe Rogan Experience', Dwayne Johnson covered a wide range of topics. From tales of his early pro wrestling days to his contemplation of a future in boxing or perhaps mixed martial arts. However, he did not touch upon the 2016 incident.</p><p>Sonnen was evidently unhappy about this, saying, “Joe Rogan had three hours to ask him [The Rock] the one thing that he wanted to ask him and either make him wilt or not. And they didn’t talk about it and they pretended, two actors pretending.”</p><h2 class=split>Internet trolls Dwayne Johnson as Chael Sonnen gives his view on 'JRE' podcast</h2><p>Since Dwayne Johnson is renowned for having charm on the mic, fans were excited about his presence on the JRE. However, it appears that listeners' excitement changed to disappointment as they responded poorly to his appearance on the well-liked show.</p><p>Rogan recently shared a photo of his workout with "The Rock" on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> before they started recording their show. Post captioned by Rogan, “Had a f**king amazing time working out with @therock @shanemgillis @tonyhinchcliffe @duncantrussell @ehsanjahmad and @duncantrussell at the studio gym!”</p><p>However, the majority of Instagram comments from followers have been critical of Johnson. A user wrote, "The rock is a sellout puppet," whereas another said, "Lost respect for rock when Maui fire happen." A third person wrote, "The rock is trying real hard to fix his reputation.</p><p>Another fan recalled, "Who remembers when the rock defended you and then deleted his comments because it was unpopular," as a fifth commented, "What a great bunch of men and then there’s the Rock!"</p><p>Sonnen's YouTube video on the podcast caused "The Rock" to receive more flak online. One person trolled the WWE champ, writing, "You have to admire the Rock's physique, especially since he did all that with no spine." "The Rock is great at delivering his wrestling catch phrases. That’s all," said another.</p><p>A third person commented, "It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever sat through. The Rock said about 500 words in the whole episode. Obviously they had agreed not to talk about steroids but to not address the attempted cancellation of Joe that the Rock went along with and draw a line under it made the whole thing painful."</p><p>The person then gave his feedback on the podcast, claiming, "Once it became clear that Dwayne wasn’t going to apologise, Joe should have brought up steroids.</p><p>Another fan of Sonnen agreed with him, saying, "100% true. They were tearing into each other on social media not too long ago. That interview just felt slightly uncomfortable to watch. Joe wouldn't go where we, as a group watching it, wanted him to."</p><p>"I had to skip an hour into the pod in order to watch it without “cringing,”" claimed one person, as a sixth noted, "Now that you bring it up, the rock did talk very much like a politician that whole podcast."</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
