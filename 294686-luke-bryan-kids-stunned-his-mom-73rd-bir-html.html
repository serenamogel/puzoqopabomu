However, she has always had the support of her son. Bryan took in his sister's three children after she passed, and he and his wife continued to do their best to keep his mother happy.</p><p class=dh>Country sensation Luke Bryan started his singing career in his hometown of Georgia, Leesburg. While he was at Georgia Southern University, he began singing in a band and quickly gained local popularity.</p><p class=dh>In his early 20s, Bryan planned to move to Nashville for better opportunities; however, everything changed when his family faced an unexpected tragedy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/fa8ba8f614b5c208eef543dcfd666c6d.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Luke Bryan in Las Vegas 209. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Just five days before Bryan's planned departure, his older brother Chris died in a car accident in November 1996. So the country singer decided to postpone his move and stay home to support his parents.</p><p class=dh>As one can imagine, his mother, LeClaire, was distraught by the loss of her son, so Bryan was mainly there to comfort her through this loss. It was a no-brainer for the singer because his mother sacrificed a lot for him.</p><p class=dh>When Bryan was young, he used to have asthma, and he recalled how he used to sleep in his mother's bed, and she would stay up all night to listen to his breathing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2315ff5fbcd0e0dfa775a12d20435343.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Luke Bryan in Las Vegas 2018. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>LeClaire also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/music/features/luke-bryan-interview-billboard-cover-story-2018-8458596/>confessed</a> that she could not bear the thought of Bryan leaving, so the country singer put his musical aspirations on hold and worked for his father, Tommy, at his fertilizer company.</p><p class=dh>The singer did not enjoy his time at the fertilizer company, but despite being unhappy, he was more than willing to continue supporting his parents.</p><p class=dh>As a parent, Tommy could not bear seeing his son unhappy, and knowing Bryan's determination to be there for him and his wife, he found a way to force Bryan to follow his dreams.</p><p class=dh>The father of three vowed to fire Bryan from his company if he did not leave for Nashville. He made it clear that it was vital for him to enjoy his youth and pursue a career he loves.</p><p class=dh>So in September 2001, Bryan arrived in Nashville, and within two months, the singer had signed a publishing deal. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/music/features/luke-bryan-interview-billboard-cover-story-2018-8458596/>said</a> he worked from Monday to Thursday and wrote about two to three songs daily.</p><p class=dh>Though the job did not pay much, Bryan still found a way to perform with his band.
